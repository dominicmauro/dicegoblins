## Cantrips

### Druidcraft


*Range: 30 feet*

*Duration: Instantaneous*

Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range. 

1. Weather Sensor. You create a Tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round. 
2. Bloom. You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom. 
3. Sensory Effect. You create a harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, spectral dancing fairies, a gentle breeze, the sound of an animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot Cube. 
4. Fire Play. You light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a campfire.

### Guidance

*Range: Touch*

*Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute*

You touch a willing creature and choose a skill. Until the spell ends, the creature adds 1d4 to any ability check using the chosen skill.

### Mending

*Range: Touch*

*Duration: Instantaneous*

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item, but it can't restore magic to such an object.

### Poison Spray

Damage Cantrip: you spray toxic mist at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 Poison damage.

*Duration: 10 minutes*

Damage Cantrip: use a Bonus Action to create a flickering flame in your hand. It remains there for the duration, emitting no heat and igniting nothing. It sheds Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet. The spell ends if you cast it again.

Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to hurl fire at a creature or an object within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Fire damage.

### Animal Friendship

*Range: 30 feet*

*Duration: 24 hours*

Target a Beast that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration. If you or one of your allies deals damage to the target, the spells ends.

### Charm Person

*Range: 30 feet*

One Humanoid you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. It does so with Advantage if you or your allies are fighting it.

When the spell ends, the target knows it was Charmed by you.

A creature you touch regains a number of Hit Points equal to 2d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

### Detect Magic

*Ritual*

*Range: Self*

*Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes*

For the duration, you sense the presence of magical effects within 30 feet of yourself. If you sense such effects, you can take the Magic action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears the magic, and if an effect was created by a spell, you learn the spell's school of magic.

The spell is blocked by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin sheet of lead.

### Faerie Fire

*Range: 60 feet*

*Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute*

Objects in a 20-foot Cube within range are outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Each creature in the Cube is also outlined if it fails a Dexterity saving throw.

Attack rolls against an affected creature or object have Advantage if the attacker can see it.

### Healing Word

### Speak With Animals

*Ritual*

*Range: Self*

*Duration: 10 minutes*

For the duration, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with Beasts, and you can use any of the Influence action's skill options with them.

### Thunderwave

*Range: Self*

*Duration: Instantaneous*

You unleash a wave of thunderous energy. Each creature in a 15-foot Cube originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 Thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

In addition, unsecured objects that are entirely within the Cube are pushed 10 feet away from you, and a thunderous boom is audible within 300 feet.
