Here's an outline for building your character.

## 1. Select a Class

Your character's class is like their job. Pick one that sounds interesting and note the important ability score(s) for that class.
   
   | Class     	| Likes          	| Primary Ability       	| Complexity 	|
   |-----------	|----------------	|-----------------------	|------------	|
   | [Barbarian](/docs/class/barbarian)	| Battle  | Strength| Average    	|
   | [Bard](/docs/class/bard)	| Performing    | Charisma  | High       	|
   | [Cleric](/docs/class/cleric)	| Gods	| Wisdom	| Average    	|
   | [Druid](/docs/class/druid)	| Nature	| Wisdom	| High       	|
   | [Fighter](/docs/class/fighter)	| Weapons	| Strength or Dexterity 	| Low        	|
   | [Monk](/docs/class/monk)	| Unarmed combat 	| Dexterity and Wisdom  	| High       	|
   | [Paladin](/docs/class/paladin)	| Defense	| Strength and Charisma 	| Average    	|
   | [Ranger](/docs/class/ranger)	| Survival	| Dexterity and Wisdom	| Average    	|
   | [Rogue](/docs/class/rogue)	| Stealth	| Dexterity	| Low	|
   | [Sorcerer](/docs/class/sorcerer)	| Power	| Charisma	| High	|
   | [Warlock](/docs/class/warlock)	| Occult lore	| Charisma	| High	|

## 2. Proficiency Bonus
   
Fill in the proficiency bonus on your character sheet: you start with a +2 bonus.

## 3. Assign Ability Scores

Give each of your six abilities one of the following scores: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10 and 8. You should assign the 15 to the Primary Ability for your class as described above. Note that in the next step, you'll increase some of these scores, so consider using scrap paper for this step.

## 4. Choose a Background

Your character's background is what they did before they learned to be an adventurer. Choose one of the backgrounds that improves the important ability score for your class. 

 | Ability   | Backgrounds   |
   |--------------|-------------|
   | Strength     | Artisan, Entertainer, Farmer, Guard, Noble, Sailor, Soldier    |
   | Dexterity    | Artisan, Charlatan, Criminal, Entertainer, Guide, Sailor, Scribe, Soldier, Wayfarer    |
   | Constitution | Charlatan, Criminal, Farmer, Guide, Hermit, Merchant, Sage, Soldier    |
   | Intelligence | Acolyte, Artisan, Criminal, Guard, Merchant, Noble, Sage, Scribe   |
   | Wisdom       | Acolyte, Farmer, Guard, Guide, Hermit, Sage, Sailor, Scribe, Wayfarer  |
   | Charisma     | Acolyte, Charlatan, Entertainer, Hermit, Merchant, Noble, Wayfarer |
   
View the [backgrounds page](/docs/backgrounds) for more details about each Background. Each Background can improve three ability scores by +1, or one ability score by +2 and a second one by +1. You cannot improve one ability score by +3. Once you've decided on a Background and decided what abilities you want to improve, write down the final ability scores on your character sheet.

In addition, write down the following benefits gained from your Background:

1. The Feat your character learned
2. Skills your character is proficient in
3. Equipment your character started their career with

## 5. Complete Core Traits

View the [Class page](/docs/class) and add your Hit Dice, weapon proficiencies, armor training and the rest of your character's starting equipment. Complete the “Weapons and Damaging Cantrips” section of your character sheet, using the table of [Weapons](/docs/gear/#weapons) and the list of [Cantrips](/docs/spells#cantrips).

## 6. Skill Proficiencies

In addition to the Skill Proficiencies you gained from your Background, your character gains a number of Skill Proficiencies based on their Class. Select those additional Skills now, and mark them on your character sheet.
 
 ## 7. Ability and Skill Modifiers
 
Each of your ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, etc.) has a Modifier based on the score.
 
 | Score 	| Modifier 	|
 |-------	|----------	|
 | 8–9   	| −1       	|
 | 10–11 	| +0       	|
 | 12–13 	| +1       	|
 | 14–15 	| +2       	|
 | 16–17 	| +3       	|
 
Fill in the Modifier next to each Ability. For each Saving Throw and Skill your character is proficient in, add your Proficiency Bonus (+2) to the Ability Modifier. Saving Throws and Skills your character is not proficient in use a simple Ability roll.

## 8. Perception, HP, Initiative, & AC

Fill in your passive perception (10 + Perception Modifier), your hit points (Based on your Class plus your Constitution Modifier), and your initiative (your Dexterity modifier), 

Using the reference table of [armor](/docs/gear/#armor), fill in your Armor Class (based on your armor and Class features).

## 9. Spellcasting

Depending on your Background, Species, and Class, you may be able to cast spells. If so, here's what to do:

- Calculate your saving throw and spell attack bonus. Your Saving Throw is 10 + your spellcasting ability modifier. 
- Your spell attack bonus is 2 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Note those on your character sheet.
- Double-check that you've selected all the cantrips and spells granted by your Species and Class (as well as the Magic Initiate feat, if you have it).
