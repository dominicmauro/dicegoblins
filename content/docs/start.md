## 3. Assign Ability Scores

All level 1 characters use the same six scores for their abilities: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8. The following table puts the highest scores in the most important abilities for each Class.

| Class     	| STR 	| DEX 	| CON 	| INT 	| WIS 	| CHA 	|
|-----------	|------	|-----	|-----	|------	|------	|------	|
| Barbarian 	| 15   	| 13  	| 14  	| 10   	| 12   	| 8    	|
| Bard      	| 8    	| 14  	| 12  	| 13   	| 10   	| 15   	|
| Cleric    	| 14   	| 8   	| 13  	| 10   	| 15   	| 12   	|
| Druid     	| 8    	| 12  	| 14  	| 13   	| 15   	| 10   	|
| Fighter   	| 15   	| 14  	| 13  	| 8    	| 10   	| 12   	|
| Monk      	| 12   	| 15  	| 13  	| 10   	| 14   	| 8    	|
| Paladin   	| 15   	| 10  	| 13  	| 8    	| 12   	| 14   	|
| Ranger    	| 12   	| 15  	| 13  	| 8    	| 14   	| 10   	|
| Rogue     	| 12   	| 15  	| 13  	| 14   	| 10   	| 8    	|
| Sorcerer  	| 10   	| 13  	| 14  	| 8    	| 12   	| 15   	|
| Warlock   	| 8    	| 14  	| 13  	| 12   	| 10   	| 15   	|
| Wizard    	| 8    	| 12  	| 13  	| 15   	| 14   	| 10   	|

After assigning your character's ability scores based on their Class, you will adjust some of the scores based on your character's Background. 

## 4. Choose a Background

Your character's Background is what they did before they learned to be an adventurer. Choose one of the Backgrounds that improves the important ability score for their Class. 

| Ability   | Backgrounds   |
|--------------|-------------|
| Strength     | Artisan, Entertainer, Farmer, Guard, Noble, Sailor, Soldier    |
| Dexterity    | Artisan, Charlatan, Criminal, Entertainer, Guide, Sailor, Scribe, Soldier, Wayfarer    |
| Constitution | Charlatan, Criminal, Farmer, Guide, Hermit, Merchant, Sage, Soldier    |
| Intelligence | Acolyte, Artisan, Criminal, Guard, Merchant, Noble, Sage, Scribe   |
| Wisdom       | Acolyte, Farmer, Guard, Guide, Hermit, Sage, Sailor, Scribe, Wayfarer  |
| Charisma     | Acolyte, Charlatan, Entertainer, Hermit, Merchant, Noble, Wayfarer |
   
View the [backgrounds page](/docs/backgrounds) for more details about each Background. Each Background improves three ability scores by +1, or one ability score by +2 and a second one by +1. You cannot improve one ability score by +3. Once you've decided on a Background and decided what abilities you want to improve, write down the final ability scores on your character sheet.

In addition, write down the following benefits gained from your character's Background:

1. The Feat your character learned
2. Skills your character is proficient in
3. Equipment your character finished their Background with

## 5. Choose a Species

Your character's Species determines their size, speed, and a number of special traits based on their physiology or magical nature. Some Species have different traits to choose from.

View the [species page](/docs/species) for more details about each Species. Choose one and add the Species Traits to your character sheet. 

## 6. Complete Core Traits

View the [Class page](/docs/class) and add your character's Hit Dice, weapon proficiencies, armor training and the rest of your character's starting equipment. Complete the “Weapons and Damaging Cantrips” section of your character sheet, using the table of [Weapons](/docs/gear/#weapons) and the list of [Cantrips](/docs/spells#cantrips).

## 7. Skill Proficiencies

In addition to the Skill Proficiencies your character gained from their Background, your character gains a number of Skill Proficiencies based on their Class. Select those additional Skills now, and mark them on your character sheet.
 
## 8. Ability and Skill Modifiers
 
Each of your character's ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, etc.) has a Modifier based on the score.
 
 | Score 	| Modifier 	|
 |-------	|----------	|
 | 8–9   	| −1       	|
 | 10–11 	| +0       	|
 | 12–13 	| +1       	|
 | 14–15 	| +2       	|
 | 16–17 	| +3       	|
 
Fill in the Modifier next to each Ability. For each Saving Throw and Skill your character is proficient in, add your Proficiency Bonus (+2) to the Ability Modifier and fill that result in. Saving Throws and Skills your character is not proficient in use a simple Ability roll.

## 9. Perception, HP, Initiative, & AC

Fill in your character's passive perception (10 + Perception Modifier), hit points (based on their Class plus their Constitution Modifier), and initiative (their Dexterity modifier), 

Using the reference table of [armor](/docs/gear/#armor), fill in your character's Armor Class (based on their armor and Class features).

## 10. Spellcasting

Depending on your character's Background, Species, and Class, they may be able to cast spells. If so, calculate the following:

- Your character's *Spell Save DC*, which is 10 + their spellcasting ability modifier.
- Your character's *Spell Attack Bonus*, which is 2 + their spellcasting ability modifier.

And note them on the top of your character sheet's second page. Then double-check that you've selected all the cantrips and spells granted by your character's Species and Class (as well as the Magic Initiate feat, if you have it).
