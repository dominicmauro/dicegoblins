Druids gain all of the following features:

## Druidic

You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have the Speak with Animals spell prepared.

You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can't decipher it without magic.

## Primal Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

**Magician**. You know one extra cantrip from the Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

**Warden**. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor.

## Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of nature. The information below details how you use Druid spells.

**Cantrips**. You know two cantrips: Druidcraft and Produce Flame.

**Spell Slots**. You have two level 1 spell slots. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells**. Each day, you prepare four spells that are available for you to cast. You have the Animal Friendship, Cure Wounds, Faerie Fire, and Thunderwave spells prepared today. The number of spells you can prepare each day will increase as you gain Druid levels.

**Spellcasting Ability**. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.

**Spellcasting Focus**. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.
