Warlocks gain all of the following features:

## Eldritch Invocations

You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one invocation of your choice:

1. **Armor of Shadows**. You can cast Mage Armor on yourself without expending a spell slot.

2. **Pact of the Blade**. As a Bonus Action, you can conjure a pact weapon in your hand: a Simple or Martial Melee weapon of your choice. Until the bond ends, you have proficiency with the weapon and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus. Whenever you attack with the pact weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity, and you can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal damage type.

## Pact Magic

Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells.

**Cantrips**. You know two Warlock cantrips: Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.

**Spell Slots**. The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells**. Each day, you prepare two level 1 spells. Today, you prepared Charm Person and Hex. The number of spells you can prepare increases as you gain Warlock levels.

**Spellcasting Ability**. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.

**Spellcasting Focus**. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.
