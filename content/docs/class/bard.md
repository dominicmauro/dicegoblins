Bards gain all of the following features:

## Bardic Inspiration
You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.

**Using Bardic Inspiration**. As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. Once within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it's rolled.

**Number of Uses**. You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts.

**Cantrips**. You know the Dancing Lights and Vicious Mockery cantrips.

**Spell Slots**. You have two level 1 spell slots. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells**. Each day, you prepare four spells that are available for you to cast. Today, you prepared Charm Person, Color Spray, Dissonant Whispers, and Healing Word. The number of spells you can prepare each day will increase as you gain Bard levels.

**Spellcasting Ability**. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.
