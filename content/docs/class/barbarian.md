Barbarians gain all of the following features:

## Rage

You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a *Bonus Action* if you aren't wearing Heavy armor. You can enter your Rage twice per day. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

While you are in Rage, you gain the following benefits:

**Damage Resistance**. You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

**Rage Damage**. When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.

**Strength Advantage.** You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

**Duration**. The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you are knocked unconscious. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:
1. Make an attack roll against an enemy.
2. Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
3. Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.
Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.

## Unarmored Defense

While you aren't wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.

## Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.
