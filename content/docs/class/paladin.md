Paladins gain all of the following features:

## Lay on Hands

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.

As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.

You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature; those points don't also restore Hit Points to the creature.

## Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.

## Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. The information below details how you use Druid spells.

**Spell Slots**. You have two level 1 spell slots. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells**. Each day, you prepare two spells that are available for you to cast. Today, you prepared Heroism and Searing Smite. The number of spells you prepare each day increases as you gain Paladin levels.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells**. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability**. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.

**Spellcasting Focus**. You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.
